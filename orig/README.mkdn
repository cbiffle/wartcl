# The Original `partcl`

This crate builds partcl from C source and wraps it in a basic Rust interface. I
use this for performance and behavioral measurement. It's probably not useful
outside of that, mostly because the interface is very specific to my needs.

The C code in this crate is covered by the `LICENSE` file.
